# Virtual Assistant

This is a simple Virtual Assistant built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to interact with a virtual assistant through a web interface that responds to voice commands and provides basic functionality, such as answering simple questions, performing tasks, and providing helpful information.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: The assistant can recognize voice commands using the Web Speech API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant responds with speech using the Web Speech API.
- **Simple Commands**: Can perform basic tasks like opening websites, telling the time, and more.
- **Responsive Interface**: The project is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the page and defining elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and ensuring a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and enabling features like speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-assistant.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd virtual-assistant
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser**:
    Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

4. **Start interacting with the virtual assistant**:
    Click on the "Start" button to activate the assistant and give voice commands.

## How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: When the user speaks a command, the virtual assistant listens and converts the speech into text using the Web Speech API.
2. **Processing Commands**: The assistant processes the text and performs the corresponding task. It can provide responses such as telling the current time or opening a website.
3. **Text-to-Speech**: The assistant responds by converting the text back to speech using the Web Speech API, so the user can hear the response.

## Future Improvements

- **Expanded Command Set**: Add more complex commands like setting reminders, sending emails, or searching the web.
- **Improved User Interface**: Enhance the design with animations or better visuals to improve user experience.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add the ability for the assistant to understand and respond in multiple languages.
